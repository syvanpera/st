st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Patches
-------
Apply patches using the `quilt` tool:
```bash
$ quilt push -a
```

 If you'd like to make changes and have them be added as new patches, use quilt:

```bash
$ quilt new my-change.patch  # create a new empty patch
$ quilt add config.def.h     # tell quilt that config.def.h is part of your new patch
$ vim config.def.h           # Make whatever changes you like
$ quilt refresh	             # tell quilt to refresh the patch based on your file changes
$ quilt pop -a               # roll all the changes back to the original source
```


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
